## To Do

### Creation Process

- Add option to choose the number of games expected to be played during the session.
- Add option to filter games by single player count value vs range.
- Add option to filter games by single time value vs range.
- Ability to set a limited number of attendees
- "Pooling" of BGG Collections if multiple users w/ BGG Profiles are added as invitees.
- Add option to be notified when invitee statuses change (new accept / decline / change)

### Game Break Management

- Add option to cancel a Game Break.
- Ability to edit game break details after creation.
- Ability to edit RSVP status.
- Based of the number of plays for a break, that should determine the number of votes for invitees
- Option to not use votes; Instead, the game options selected are assumed to be the games played during the session

### Viewing Game Break

- Hide attendee information from guests
- Display cancellation page if Break is attempted to be accessed after cancelled.
- Mobile (sm) view needs to be adjusted

### Notifications

- Send notice of cancellation to Game Break attendees if accepted when cancelled. 
- Reminder emails to go out the day and hour before the session begins. 

### Other

- Ability to search for games not within your linked BGG collection.
- Ability to create "game groups" which will be preselected invitees.
- Ability to opt-in / out of reminder notifications.
- Ability to create recurring game break sessions.
- Ability to allow open registration
  - A sharable link that will allow anyone to add themselves as an invitee to the game break.
- Dark Mode Styles
- Selecting games overall
  - Should be able to select a game, search for new, and not loose the original selection
  - The "popping" of the page as you move the slider is annoying. Should only update after releasing the drag button?

### Mobile Application Specific

- Push notifications vs just email
- Add invitees direct from phone contacts
- 

### The Intended Workflow for Attendee

- Receive initial invite
- View Game Break and quickly understand who is invited and what games are being offered (what type of experience is this going to be?)
- Decline or Accept
- Quickly review the available games. Understand time commitment and type of game experience. Easy access to BGG for details.
- Vote on my favorite(s) OR don't vote OR I'm new and not sure what I want, perhaps a type of game vote? Maybe this is on the organizer.
- When the game decision has been made, send out an update to everyone.
- Provide easy access to game overview and rules explanation.
