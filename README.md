## About Game Break

Game Break is an application focused around organizing table-top board game play 
sessions. Users can link their BGG Profile pulling in their game collections. Creation
of a new Game Break allows a user to select the games available to play and invite other 
players. Game Break will share the sessions details (location, date, etc.) manage RSVPs,
and allow invitees to vote of which games they'd like to see played. 

When time for the session arrives, the organizer and attendees will know how many players
to expect and what games are most desirable to help get players playing faster. 

## Under Development

Game Break is still under development and not yet ready for general use.
